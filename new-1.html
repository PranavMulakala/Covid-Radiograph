<h2>How to play the Game</h2>
    </head>
<body>
    <p>Playing the game of basketball is not very easy. First you need to learn the basics of it to play good. Let me tell you some of the basics of basketball, I won't go to deep into the rules.
      <ol>
        <li>Basketball courts consists of out-of-bounds. These are lines that indicate that you or the ball should not go past it.</li>
        <li>The outer line that is a ark in front of the hoop indicates that whatever shot is taken outside the ark is considerd 3 points. And whatever inside is worth 2 points</li>
        <li>You can only dribble the ball with one hand, and when you pick the ball up with two hands you have to stop dribbling and rotate to pass the ball. Otherwise if you don't this is considered a pealty.</li>
        <li>You can only dribble the ball and move. Before you take a shot you can take 2 steps at the max and then take the shot. If you don't this is a penalty called, "Traveling" (ex:layups)</li>
        <li> Penalties are contact with the person who you are physically hit. If you are shooting and the person who is defending you hits your body, you get how many shot at the staright line that is horizontal to the hoop. If youg get fouled inside ark you get two shots. Outside the ark is three shots. They are either are resulted in shooting or passing a ball if fouled not while shooting.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> I could go on and on with more deep down rules, but what I told are the ones that you play with your friends unless you are in an offical game. But those rules I will save for later</p>
